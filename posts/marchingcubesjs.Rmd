In [this gist of mine](https://gist.github.com/stla/69bbbd59fab9d46cc5f49860eaf9f052), 
there is a Javascript implementation of the marching cubes algorithm. 
The code is an adaptation of the algorithm implemented in `misc3d`, a R package 
written by Dai Feng and Luke Tierney.

The algorithm returns a triangulation of an isosurface, that is to say the 
surface defined by an implicit equation
$$
f(x,y,z) = \ell.
$$

The triangulation is returned by

```javascript
marchingCubes(f, l, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax, nx, ny, nz)
```
where `xmin` and `xmax` are the bounds of the $x$ variable and `nx` is the 
number of subdivisions between `xmin` and `xmax`, and similarly for the $y$ 
and $z$ variables.

The output is a $(n \times 3)$-array of vertices. Grouping the rows by chunks 
of three provides the triangles.

As an illustration, below is a Dupin cyclide triangulated by the marching cubes 
algorithm and rendered with `three.js`. 
The full code is available in the source.
