We prove Prohorov's theorem for a Lusin space, and we prove that 
the space of probability measures on a Lusin space is Lusin. 

# Space of probability measures

For a topological space $E$, we denote by $\mathcal{B}_E$ 
the Borel $\sigma$-field on $E$, by $C_b(E)$ the space of 
real-valued bounded continuous functions on $E$ and by 
$\Pr(E)$ the topological space of probabilities on $E$ equipped with the 
narrow topology. 

The *canonical basis of neighborhoods* at $\mu \in \Pr(E)$ is the 
family of open sets
$$
\Bigl\{\nu\in\Pr(E) \mid
\bigl|\nu(f_i)-\mu(f_i)\bigl| < \epsilon, i\in [\![1,k]\!]\Bigr\}
$$
for $\epsilon>0$, $k \geqslant 1$ and $f_i \in C_b(E)$. 

In the next section, we will use the fact that 
a net $(\mu_\lambda)$ in $\Pr(E)$ converges to $\mu_\infty \in \Pr(E)$ 
if and only if $\mu_\lambda(f) \to \mu_\infty(f)$ for every $f \in C_b(E)$. 


**Proposition 1.** *Let $\mu\in\Pr(E)$ and $(\mu_n)$ be a sequence in $\Pr(E)$. 
If $\limsup \mu_n(F) \leqslant \mu(F)$ for all closed sets $F\subset E$, 
then $(\mu_n)$ converges to $\mu$. The converse is true if $E$ is metrizable.* 

*Proof.* See 
[The conditional law as a random probability](./conditionalLaw.html). 
&square;


**Lemma 2.** *Let $E$ be a metrizable space, and $A \in \mathcal{B}_E$. 
The map $\Pr(E) \ni \mu \mapsto \mu(A) \in [0,1]$ is Borel measurable.*

*Proof.* Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the class of $A \in \mathcal{B}_E$ such that 
the map $\mu \mapsto \mu(A)$ is measurable. 
For every $f \in C_b(E)$, the map $\mu \mapsto \mu(f)$ is continuous, hence 
it is measurable. 
Let $F \subset E$ be closed. For every integer $n\geqslant 1$ 
define $f_n\in C_b(E)$ by $f_n(x)=\max\bigl\{0,1-n d(x,F)\bigr\}$ 
where $d$ is a metric on $E$ compatible with the topology. 
Then $f_n(x)\downarrow\mathbf{1}_F(x)$ for every $x\in E$. 
By monotone convergence, $F \in \mathcal{D}$. 
It is not difficult to check that $\mathcal{D}$ is a $\lambda$-system. 
By the monotone class theorem, $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{B}_E$.

# Prohorov's theorem in the Lusin case

Here we give a proof of Prohorov's theorem for a Lusin space $E$, 
*i.e.* $E$ is homeomorphic to a Borel subset of a compact metric space. 
We follow [2]. We will only admit 
Stone-Weierstrass's theorem and Riesz's representation theorem, and 
the theorems used in the proof of the following theorem, 
which shows that the Lusin assumption is enough for us.

**Theorem 3.** *A Polish space is Lusin. More precisely, a Polish space is 
homeomorphic to a $G_\delta$ subset of the Hilbert cube ${[0,1]}^\mathbb{N}$.*

*Proof.* See theorems 3.11 and 4.14 in [1]. &square;


**Proposition 4.** *Let $(K,d)$ be a compact metric space. Then 
$C(K)$ is separable and $\Pr(K)$ is compact metrizable*.

*Proof.* As a compact metric space, $K$ is separable. Let 
$(x_n)$ be a dense sequence of $K$ and define $h_n \in C(K)$ by 
$h_n(x)=d(x,x_n)$. The family of functions $\{h_n\}$ separates points of $K$, 
that is to say, for every $x,y \in K$, there exists $i$ such that 
$h_i(x) \neq h_i(y)$. Indeed, let $x,y\in K$ be distinct. Take 
$(n_j)$ such that $d(x,x_{n_j}) \to 0$. If we had 
$h_i(x) = h_i(y)$ for every $i$, we would have $d(y,x_{n_j}) \to 0$, 
therefore we would have $x=y$.

Consider the subalgebra $A$ of $C(K)$ consisting of all polynomials in 
the $h_k$, that is, the class of functions that are finite sums of the form 
$$
q\mathbf{1} + 
\sum q_{k_1,\ldots,k_r;n_1,\ldots,n_r}h_{k_1}^{n_1}\cdots h_{k_r}^{n_r},
$$
where $q$ and the $q_{k_1,\ldots,k_r;n_1,\ldots,n_r}$ are rational constants. 
The closure of this subalgebra is a subalgebra of $C(J)$, it contains all 
constant functions and it separates points of $K$. 
Therefore, by Stone-Weierstrass's theorem (see [3]), $A$ is dense in $C(K)$. 
Hence $C(K)$ is separable because $A$ is countable. 
Let $(f_n)$ be a dense sequence in $C(K)$. Consider the map 
$$
\begin{array}{rccl}
\Phi\colon & \Pr(K) & \to & V := 
\displaystyle\prod_{n=1}^\infty
\bigl[-{\Vert f_n\Vert}_\infty, {\Vert f_n\Vert}_\infty\bigr] \\
& \mu & \mapsto & \bigl(\mu(f_1), \mu(f_2), \ldots \bigr)
\end{array}.
$$

- The map $\Phi$ is injective: if $\mu,\nu\in\Pr(K)$ satisfy 
$\mu(f_n) = \nu(f_n)$ for every $n$, then $\mu(f)=\nu(f)$ for every 
$f\in C(K)$ by dominated convergence; this implies $\mu=\nu$ 
(theorem 1.2 in [4]). 

- The map $\Phi$ is continuous because each coordinate map $\mu\mapsto\mu(f_n)$ 
is continuous. 

- The map $\Phi^{-1}$ is continuous. Indeed, take a net 
${(v_\lambda)}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$ in $\Phi(V)$ converging to 
$v_\infty \in \Phi(V)$. Let $\mu_\lambda$ such that 
$v_\lambda = \Phi(\mu_\lambda)$ for every 
$\lambda \in \Lambda\cup\{\infty\}$. 
Thus $\mu_\lambda(f_j) \to \mu_\infty(f_j)$ for every $j \geqslant 1$. 
For any $f\in C(K)$, we have
$$
\bigl|\mu_\lambda(f) - \mu_\infty(f)\bigr| \leqslant 
2{\Vert f-f_j\Vert}_\infty + 
\bigl|\mu_\lambda(f_j) - \mu_\infty(f_j)\bigr|
$$
for every $\lambda$ and every $j$. Hence
$$
\limsup_{\lambda} \bigl|\mu_\lambda(f) - \mu_\infty(f)\bigr| 
\leqslant 2{\Vert f-f_j\Vert}_\infty.
$$
There exists a subsequence of ${\Vert f-f_j\Vert}_\infty$ converging to $0$. 
It follows that
$$
\limsup_{\lambda} \bigl|\mu_\lambda(f) - \mu_\infty(f)\bigr| = 0 
= \lim_{\lambda} \bigl|\mu_\lambda(f) - \mu_\infty(f)\bigr|
$$
for all $f\in C(K)$, hence $\mu_\lambda \to \mu_\infty$.  

Thus $\Phi$ is a homeomorphism. 
It remains to show that $\Phi\bigl(\Pr(K)\bigr)$ is closed in the 
compact space $V$. Since $V$ is metrizable (as a countable product of 
metrizable spaces), it suffices to show that 
a sequence of $\Phi\bigl(\Pr(K)\bigr)$ converges in $\Phi\bigl(\Pr(K)\bigr)$ 
whenever it converges in $V$. 
Let $(\mu_k)$ be a sequence in $\Pr(K)$ such that the 
sequence $\bigl(\Phi(\mu_k)\bigr)$ converges to 
$(\alpha_n) \in V$. 
Let $f \in C_b(K)$. There exists a sequence $(j_r)$ of integers such that 
${\Vert f_{j_r} - f \Vert}_\infty \to 0$. We have
$$
\bigl|\mu_n(f) - \mu_m(f)\bigr| \leqslant 2{\Vert f-f_{j_r}\Vert}_\infty + 
\bigl|\mu_n(f_{j_r}) - \mu_m(f_{j_r})\bigr|.
$$
The second term of the sum goes to $0$ as $m,n\to\infty$ because 
$\mu_k(f_{j_r})$ is the $j_r$-th component of $\Phi(\mu_k)$, which goes 
to $\alpha_{j_r}$. Hence
$$
\limsup_{m,n\to\infty} 
\bigl|\mu_n(f) - \mu_m(f)\bigr| \leqslant 2{\Vert f-f_{j_r}\Vert}_\infty,
$$
therefore
$$
\limsup_{m,n\to\infty} \bigl|\mu_n(f) - \mu_m(f)\bigr| = 0.
$$
Thus the limit $\lim \mu_n(f) =: \Lambda(f)$ exists. The map 
$f \mapsto \Lambda(f)$ is an increasing linear functional on $C(K)$ 
which maps $\mathbf{1}$ to $1$. 
By Riesz's representation theorem (see [3]), there exists 
$\mu\in\Pr(K)$ such that $\Lambda(f) = \mu(f)$. In particular 
$\mu(f_j) = \alpha_j$, thus $\Phi(\mu) = (\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\ldots)$. 
In other words, $\Phi\bigl(\Pr(K)\bigr)$ is closed in $V$. 
&square;


Hereafter, $E$ denotes a *Lusin space*, which means that $E$ is homeomorphic 
to a Borel subset $E'$ of a compact metric space $(K,d)$. 
Let $A\subset K$ be a Borel set.  
Any $\mu\in\Pr(E)$ can be extended to a probability $\hat\mu\in\Pr(K)$ by 
setting 
$$
\hat\mu(A') = \mu\bigl(\iota^{-1}(A'\cap E')\bigr) 
= \mu\bigl(\iota^{-1}(A')\cap E\bigr)
$$
where $\iota\colon E \to E'$ is a homeomorphism. 
Observe that $\hat\mu(K\setminus E') = 0$. 
The map $\mu \mapsto \hat\mu$ is injective because $\iota$ is a 
bimeasurable bijection. Its image is the set 
$$
Q = \bigl\{\nu \in \Pr(K) \mid \nu(E')=1\bigr\}.
$$
Indeed, if $\nu \in Q$, then $\nu = \hat\mu$ for the probability 
$\mu \in \Pr(E)$ defined by $\mu(A) = \nu(\iota(A))$. 

**Lemma 5.** *The map 
$Q \ni \nu \mapsto \nu_{|\mathcal{B}_{E'}} \in \Pr(E')$ 
is continuous.*

*Proof.* Denote this map by $\kappa$. 
Since $\Pr(K)$ is metrizable by Proposition 3, $Q$ is 
metrizable as well, and it suffices to 
show that $\kappa$ is sequentially continuous. 
Take a sequence $(\mu_n)$ in $Q$ and $\mu_\infty \in Q$ such that 
$\mu_n \to \mu_\infty$ in $Q$. 
One also has $\mu_n \to \mu_\infty$ in $\Pr(K)$, and then, by Proposition 1, 
$$
\forall F\subset K \text{ closed}, \limsup \mu_n(F) 
\leqslant \mu_\infty(F). 
$$
Let $F' \subset E'$ closed, hence $F' = F \cap E'$ for a closed $F \subset K$. 
Then 
$$
\limsup \kappa(\mu_n)(F') = \limsup \mu_n(F') 
\leqslant \limsup \mu_n(F) \leqslant \mu_\infty(F).
$$
But $\mu_\infty \in Q$, therefore 
$\mu_\infty(F) = \mu_\infty(F') = \kappa(\mu_\infty)(F')$. 
By Proposition 1, $\kappa(\mu_n) \to \kappa(\mu_\infty)$ in $\Pr(E')$.
&square;


**Lemma 6.** *The subset $Q$ of $\Pr(K)$ is homeomorphic to $\Pr(E')$. 
The map $\Phi\colon\Pr(E')\to Q$ defined by $\Phi(\nu)(A) = \nu(A\cap E')$ is 
a homeomorphism.*

*Proof.* 
One has $\mathcal{B}_{E'} = \{A\cap E' \mid A \in \mathcal{B}_K\}$. 
Hence it is clear that $\Phi$ is injective. 
Let $\mu\in Q$ and $A'\in\mathcal{B}_{E'}$. 
One has $A' = A\cap E'$ for a certain $A \in \mathcal{B}_K$. 
Define $\mu'(A') = \mu(A)$. Since $\mu(A) = \mu(A\cap E')=\mu(A')$, 
this definition of $\mu'(A')$ does not depend on the choice of $A$. 
In fact $\mu' = \mu_{|\mathcal{B}_{E'}}$. So $\mu' \in \Pr(E')$ and 
$\Phi(\mu') = \mu$. Thus $\Phi$ is surjective. 

Lemma 5 says that the inverse map $\Phi^{-1}$ is continuous.

Now we will show that $\Phi$ is continuous. 
The space $\Pr(E')$ is pseudometrizable: we know from the previous 
proposition that $\Pr(K)$ is metrizable, and with the help of a metric 
$\rho$ on $\Pr(K)$ one can define a pseudometric $\rho'$ on $\Pr(E')$ by 
$\rho'(\mu',\nu') = \rho\bigl(\Phi(\mu'),\Phi(\nu')\bigr)$. 
Therefore it is sufficient to prove that $\Phi$ is sequentially continuous. 

The map $\Phi$ is sequentially continuous. Indeed, consider a sequence 
$(\nu_n)$ in $\Pr(E')$ and $\nu_\infty \in \Pr(E')$ such that 
$\nu_n \mapsto \nu_\infty$ in $\Pr(E')$. 
By Proposition 1, one has 
$\limsup\nu_n(F')\leqslant\nu_\infty(F')$ for all closed $F' \subset E'$. 
Let $F \subset K$ be closed. One has 
$\Phi(\nu_n)(F) = \nu_n(F \cap E')$. But $F \cap E'$ is closed in $E'$. 
Therefore
$$
\limsup \Phi(\nu_n)(F) = \limsup \nu_n(F \cap E') 
\leqslant \nu_\infty(F \cap E') = \Phi(\nu_\infty)(F).
$$
By Proposition 1, $\Phi(\nu_n) \to \Phi(\nu_\infty)$ in $\Pr(K)$. 
Hence $\Phi(\nu_n) \to \Phi(\nu_\infty)$ in $Q$. 
Indeed, for every $\Pr(K)$-neighborhood $V$ of $\Phi(\nu_\infty)$, 
there exists an integer $N$ such that $\Phi(\nu_n) \in V$ for every 
$n \geqslant N$. 
Let $W$ be a $Q$-neighborhood of $\Phi(\nu_\infty)$, thus 
$W = V \cap Q$ where $V$ is a $\Pr(K)$-neighborhood of $\Phi(\nu_\infty)$. 
There exists $N$ such that $\Phi(\nu_n) \in V$ for every $n \geqslant N$. 
But $\Phi(\nu_n) \in Q$, hence $\Phi(\nu_n) \in W$. 
Thus $\Phi(\nu_n) \to \Phi(\nu_\infty)$ in $Q$.
&square;


**Theorem 7.** *The map $\mu\mapsto\hat\mu$ defined above is a homeomorphism 
from $\Pr(E)$ to the subset $Q$ of $\Pr(K)$. Hence $\Pr(E)$ is metrizable.*

*Proof.* This map is bijective. 
Let $(\mu_\lambda)$ be a net in $\Pr(E)$ and $\mu_\infty\in\Pr(E)$. 
We must show that the $\Pr(E)$-convergence $\mu_\lambda\to\mu_\infty$ and 
the $Q$-convergence 
$\widehat{\mu_\lambda}\to\widehat{\mu_\infty}$ are equivalent. 
By the previous lemma, this $Q$-convergence is equivalent to the 
$\Pr(E')$-convergence 
$\Phi(\widehat{\mu_\lambda})\to\Phi(\widehat{\mu_\infty})$.

Observe that $\nu(f) = \Phi(\hat\nu)(f\circ\iota^{-1})$ for every 
$\nu \in \Pr(E)$ and all $f\in C_b(E)$. Indeed, this is true 
when $f$ is the indicator function of a Borel set of $E$ and hence 
this is also true when $f$ is a finite linear combination of 
such indicator functions. But every $f \in C_b(E)$ is the dominated 
limit of a sequence $(f_n)$ of such linear combinations: take
$$
f_n(x) = 
\sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{j-1}{n} 
\mathbf{1}_{f^{-1}\left(\left]\frac{j-1}{n},\frac{j}{n}\right]\right)}(x).
$$
Therefore the equality 
holds for every $f\in C_b(E)$ by dominated convergence. 

Assume that $\mu_\lambda\to\mu_\infty$ and take $f' \in C_b(E')$. 
Then $f' = f \circ \iota^{-1}$ for $f = f'\circ\iota \in C_b(E)$, and 
$\nu(f) = \Phi(\hat\nu)(f')$ for all $\nu\in\Pr(E)$. 
Therefore 
$$
\Phi(\widehat{\mu_\lambda})(f') = \mu_\lambda(f) \to \mu_\infty(f) 
= \Phi(\widehat{\mu_\infty})(f').
$$
That shows that $\Phi(\widehat{\mu_\lambda}) \to \Phi(\widehat{\mu_\infty})$.

Now assume that $\Phi(\widehat{\mu_\lambda})\to\Phi(\widehat{\mu_\infty})$ 
in $\Pr(E')$. Let $f \in C_b(E)$ and define 
$f' = f \circ \iota^{-1} \in C_b(E')$. Then 
$$
\mu_\lambda(f) = \Phi(\widehat{\mu_\lambda})(f') 
\to \Phi(\widehat{\mu_\infty})(f') = \mu_\infty(f).
$$
Therefore $\mu_\lambda \to \mu_\infty$.
&square;


**Theorem 8.** *The space $\Pr(E)$ is a Lusin space.*

*Proof.* The subset $Q$ of $\Pr(K)$ is Borel by Lemma 2. 
By Proposition 4, $\Pr(K)$ is compact and metrizable. Thus the 
result follows from Lemma 7.
&square;


**Theorem (Prohorov).** *If $\Lambda \subset \Pr(E)$ is tight, 
then every sequence in $\Lambda$ has a convergent subsequence.*

*Proof.* 
For every $\epsilon>0$, let $K_\epsilon \subset E$ be a compact subset of $E$ 
such that $\mu(K_\epsilon) > 1-\epsilon$ for all $\mu\in\Lambda$. 
Let $(\mu_n)$ be a sequence in $\Lambda$. 
We know by the first proposition of this section that $\Pr(K)$ is compact 
metrizable, therefore the sequence $(\widehat{\mu_n})$ has a convergent 
subsequence $(\widehat{\mu_{n_k}})$. Denote by $\nu \in \Pr(K)$ its limit. 
Let $A_\epsilon = \iota(K_\epsilon) \subset E'$. 
One has $\widehat{\mu_{n_k}}(A_\epsilon) = \mu_{n_k}(K_\epsilon) > 1-\epsilon$. 
By Proposition 1, one has 
$\limsup_k \widehat{\mu_{n_k}}(A_\epsilon) \leqslant \nu(A_\epsilon)$. 
Therefore $\nu(E') \geqslant \nu(A_\epsilon) \geqslant 1-\epsilon$. 
Since this is true for every $\epsilon>0$, $\nu(E') = 1$. 
Thus the sequence $(\widehat{\mu_{n_k}})$ is a sequence in $Q$ 
and its limit is in $Q$. Therefore it converges in $Q$. 
By Theorem 7, the sequence $(\mu_{n_k})$ converges in $\Pr(E)$.
&square;


# Kernels as random probabilities

Here we prove that a probability kernel on a Lusin space defines a 
measurable random probability. 

**Lemma 9.** *Let $E$ be a Lusin space and $\Omega$ be a probability space. 
Then a map $\Gamma\colon\Omega\to\Pr(E)$ is measurable if and only if 
$\omega\mapsto\Gamma_\omega(f)$ is measurable for every $f\in C_b(E)$, 
where we denote by $\Gamma_\omega$ the probability 
$\mathcal{B}_E \ni A \mapsto \Gamma(\omega)(A)$.*

*Proof.* 
In [The conditional law as a random probability](./conditionalLaw.html), 
we proved this result for a Polish space $E$. 
But we only used the fact that $\Pr(E)$ is strongly Lindel√∂f in this case. 
The space $\Pr(E)$ is Lusin by Theorem 8, 
[hence it is strongly Lindel√∂f](./Lusin.html). 
&square; 

**Theorem 10.** *Let $E$ be a metric space. 
Let $\Omega$ be a probability space, and $\Gamma\colon\Omega\to\Pr(E)$ be a map. 
We denote by $\Gamma_\omega$ the image of $\omega$ by $\Gamma$. 
Define the map  $K\colon\Omega\times\mathcal{B}_E \to [0,1]$ by 
$K(\omega,A) = \Gamma_\omega(A)$. 
If $\Gamma$ is measurable, then $K$ is a probability kernel 
from $\Omega$ to $E$. 
If $E$ is Lusin, the converse is true.* 

*Proof.* We proved the direct implication in 
[The conditional law as a random probability](./conditionalLaw.html). 
We also proved the converse for a Polish space $E$, but to do so we used 
the same lemma as Lemma 9 for a Polish space $E$. 
Thus the proof is similar for a Lusin space, using Lemma 9.
&square;
